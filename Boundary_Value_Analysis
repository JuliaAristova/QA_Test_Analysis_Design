***** TASK 3 *****

A developer was asked to implement the following business rule:
INPUT: value (integer number)
  IF (value ≤ 100 OR value ≥ 200) THEN write “value incorrect”
  ELSE write “value OK”

You design the test cases using 2-value boundary value analysis.
Which of the following sets of test inputs achieves the greatest coverage?

a) 100, 150, 200, 201
b) 99, 100, 200, 201
c) 98, 99, 100, 101
d) 101, 150, 199, 200

SOLUTION
  --  99    | 100        200  | 201  ---
2-BVA - 99, 100, 200, 201 --> full coverage - b

***** TASK 4 *****

You are testing a temperature control system for a horticultural cold storage facility.
The system receives a the temperature (in full degrees Celsius) as the input. 
If the temperatyr is between 0 and 2 degrees inclusive, the system displays the message 'temperature OK'
For lower temperatures. the system displays the message 'temperature too low' and
for higher temperatures it displays the message 'temperature too high'

Using two-value boundary analysis, which of the following sets of test inputs provides the highest level of boundary coverage?

a) -1, 3
b) 0, 2
c) -1, 0, 2, 3
d) -2, 0, 2, 4

SOLUTION:
--    -1    | 0   2  |   3 --  
Boundaries:    -1  0  2  3
a) 2 boundaries
b) 2 boundaries
c) 4 boundaries    - correct answer
d) 2 boundaries
