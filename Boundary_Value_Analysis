***** TASK 1 *****

You are testing a system that calculates the final course grade for a given student.
The final grade is assigned based on the final result, according to the following rules:
0 – 50 points: failed
51 – 60 points: fair
61 – 70 points: satisfactory
71 – 80 points: good
81 – 90 points: very good
91 – 100 points: excellent
You have prepared the following set of test cases:
                      Final  result        Final  grade
TC1                   91                   excellent
TC2                   50                   failed
TC3                   81                   very good
TC4                   60                   fair
TC5                   70                   satisfactory
TC6                   80                   good
What is the 2-value Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) coverage for the final result that is achieved with  the existing test cases?
a) 50%
b) 60%
c) 33.3%
d) 100%

SOLUTION
Boundary values:  0  50  51  60  61  70  71  80  81  90  91  100      --> 12
                  -  +        +       +      +    +   -  +    -       --> 6
6/12 --> 50 coverage

***** TASK 2 *****

You are testing a form that verifies the correctness of the length of the password given as input.
The form accepts a password with the correct length and rejects a password that is too short or toolong.  
The password length is correct if it has between 6 and 12 characters inclusive. Otherwise, itis considered incorrect.
At first, the form is empty (password length = 0). You apply boundary value analysis to the “password length” variable.

Your set of test cases achieves 100% 2-value boundary value coverage. The team decided that due to the high risk of this component, 
test cases should be added to ensure 100% 3-value boundary value coverage.
Which additional password lengths should be tested to achieve this?

a) 4, 5, 13, 14
b) 7, 11
c) 1, 5, 13
d) 1, 4, 7, 11, 14

SOLUTION
0-5    6-12  13
2-BVA  0     5 6      12 13
3-BVA  0 1 4 5 6 7 11 12 13 14
d) 1, 4, 7, 11, 14 -- correct answer



***** TASK 3 *****

A developer was asked to implement the following business rule:
INPUT: value (integer number)
  IF (value ≤ 100 OR value ≥ 200) THEN write “value incorrect”
  ELSE write “value OK”

You design the test cases using 2-value boundary value analysis.
Which of the following sets of test inputs achieves the greatest coverage?

a) 100, 150, 200, 201
b) 99, 100, 200, 201
c) 98, 99, 100, 101
d) 101, 150, 199, 200

SOLUTION
  --  99    | 100        200  | 201  ---
2-BVA - 99, 100, 200, 201 --> full coverage - b

***** TASK 4 *****

You are testing a temperature control system for a horticultural cold storage facility.
The system receives a the temperature (in full degrees Celsius) as the input. 
If the temperatyr is between 0 and 2 degrees inclusive, the system displays the message 'temperature OK'
For lower temperatures. the system displays the message 'temperature too low' and
for higher temperatures it displays the message 'temperature too high'

Using two-value boundary analysis, which of the following sets of test inputs provides the highest level of boundary coverage?

a) -1, 3
b) 0, 2
c) -1, 0, 2, 3
d) -2, 0, 2, 4

SOLUTION:
--    -1    | 0   2  |   3 --  
Boundaries:    -1  0  2  3
a) 2 boundaries
b) 2 boundaries
c) 4 boundaries    - correct answer
d) 2 boundaries
