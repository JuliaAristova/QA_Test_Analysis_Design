Equivalence Partitioning (EP) divides data into partitions based on the expectation that all the elements of a given partition
are to be processed in te same way by the test object.

EP can be identified for any data element related to the test object (inouts, outputs, configuration items, internal values. time-related values,
and interface parametes).
Can be 
- continuos & discrete
- ordered & unordered
- finite & infinite
Must not overlap
Must be non-empty sets.

VALID partition - contains valid values (should be processed by the tet object)
INVALID partition - contains invalid values (should be ignored/rejected by the test object)

COVERAGE
        number of exercised partitions by at least one TC / total number of identified partitions * 100%

100% coverage - all identified valid and invalid partitions are exercised.

Many test items include multiple sets of partitions (test item with more than one input parameter) -->
TC will cover partitions from different sets of partitions.
The simplest coverage criterion - Each Choice Coverage - requires to exercise eac partition from each set of partitions at least once
(see garden&floor), it does not take into account combinations of partitions.

***** TASK 1 *****

You are testing a simplified apartment search form which has only two search criteria:
- floor (with three possible options: ground floor; first floor; second or higher floor)
- garden type (with three possible options: no garden; small garden; large garden)

Only apartments on the ground floor have gardens. The form has a built-in validation mechanism
that will not allow you to use the search criteria which violate this rule.
Each test has two input values: floor and garden type. You want to apply equivalence partitioning (EP) 
to cover each floor and each garden type in your tests.
What is the minimal number of test cases to achieve 100% EP coverage?

a) 3
b) 4
c) 5
d) 6

SOLUTION

        FLOOR    | ground    |    first    | second
-----------------------------------------------------
GARDEN                             x            x
NO                
small                x            ---            ---
large                x            ---            ---

4 TCs
“Small garden” and “large garden” can go only with “ground floor”, so we need two test cases with “ground floor” 
which cover these two “garden type” partitions.
We need two more test cases to cover the two other “floor” partitions and a remaining ”garden type” partition of “no garden”.
We need a total of four test cases:
TC1 (ground floor, small garden)
TC2 (ground floor, large garden)
TC3 (first floor, no garden)
TC4 (second or higher floor, no garden)

***** TASK 2 *****

Customers of the TestWash car wash chain have cards with a record of the number of washes they have bought so far. 
The initial value is 0. After entering the car wash, the system increases the number on the card by one. 
This value represents the number of the current wash. 
Based on this number the system decides what discount the customer is entitled to.
For every tenth wash the system gives a 10% discount, 
and for every twentieth wash, the system gives a further 40% discount (i.e., a 50% discount in total).

Which of the following sets of input data (understood as the numbers of the current wash) achieves
the highest equivalence partition coverage?
a) 19, 20, 30
b) 11, 12, 20
c) 1, 10, 50
d) 10, 29, 30, 31

SOLUTION

Partitions:
A        0-9, 11-19, 21-29, etc.                no discount
B        10, 30, 50, etc.                       10%
C        20, 40, 60, etc,                       50%

a) 19, 20, 30         - A C B
b) 11, 12, 20         - B B C
c) 1, 10, 50          - A B B
d) 10, 29, 30, 31     - B A B A

a (19,20,30) - covers 100%
***** TASK 3 *****

You are testing a PIN validator which accepts valid PINs and rejects invalid PINs. A PIN is a sequence of digits. 
A PIN is valid if it consists of four digits and at least two of them are different.
Which of the following sets of input test data cover all equivalence partitions for this scenario?

a) 112, 1111, 1234, 123456
b) 1, 123, 1111, 1234
c) 12, 112, 1112, 11112
d) 1, 111, 1111, 11111

SOLUTION
    0 - 3 digits   |  4 digits & two different | 4 digits & >2 same  | >5 digits
a     112             1234                        1111                 123456
b     1, 123          1234                        1111
c     12, 112         1112                                              11112  
d     1, 111                                      1111                  11111

a - covers all partitions

***** TASK 4 *****
The system for celling cinema tickets calculaltes the discount type based on the client's birth year(BY) and on the curren year (CY) as follows:

Let D be the difference between CY and BY, that is D = CY - BY

If D < 0          then print the error message 'birth year cannot be greater that current year'
If 0 <= D < 18    then apply the student discount
If 18 <= D < 65    then apply no discount
If D >= 65        then apply the pensioner discount

Your test suite already containg two test cases:
BY = 1990, CY  = 2020    expected result: no discount
BY = 2030, CY  = 2029    expected result: print the error message

Which of the following test data sets should be added to achieve full valid equivalence partitioning coverage for the discount type?
a) BY = 2001,  CY = 2065
b) BY = 1900,  CY = 1965
c) BY = 1965,  CY = 1900
d) BY = 2011,  CY = 2029
e) BY = 2000,  CY = 2000
